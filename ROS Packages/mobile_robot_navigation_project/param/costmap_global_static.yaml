#The costmap should have the same plugins statement at the end. More-
#over, you can add any extra layers you want. The structure of the topics will
#change a little bit, since the footprint is now inside the layers and the costmaps
#are divided in multiple topics. You can get to know a little more about this
#organization in the Using rviz section."
